# Mapping the Met

# Project Description
This project seeks to highlight biases and patterns in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's collecting practices by mapping the locations of their "Highlights" works. The "Highlights" are objects that Met staff have presumably categorized as high-quality or culturally significant. This type of subjective classification is prone to bias on the part of those selecting these works, and by mapping their locations of origins, we can determine if these biases are location- or culture-based. 
# Rationale Statement
Museums' collecting and curation practices are inherently biased, especially at large museums with objects from a range of cultures. In the United States, museums often prioritize the display and study of works from white, Western societies. By mapping the locations of origin of objects, this project is an attempt to determine whether the works that the Met considers "Highlights" are mostly from these cultures, or if any other patterns emerge from the data.
# Workflow: identifies libraries used and explains the important steps being taken in the code.
This project uses the Metropolitan Museum of Art's API to map works via Plotly.
- The works will

# further uses: in what ways might someone build on this work or re-use your code.
The code used in this project might be repurposed to determine other trends in the Met's collecting practices. 
# files list: a list of files relevant to the project (python notebooks, csv files, etc) and a brief description of what each file contains
